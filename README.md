# kilo
This repository is me following along with the wonderful tutorial [here](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) that is based on the work of [antirez](https://github.com/antirez) `kilo` text editor. It's awesome. Maybe I'll try extend it, in my own way. I dunno.

Here's a photo of a cool 90s terminal, because why not?
